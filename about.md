<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">
My name is <span itemprop="givenName">Theo</span> <span itemprop="familyName">Winter</span>. I was born on <span itemprop="birthDate">15.09.1991</span> in Switzerland, so I'm of
<span itemprop="nationality">swiss</span> nationality. I'm <span itemprop="gender">male</span> and approximately <span itemprop="height">183cm</span> tall.
And I'm studying information science at <a href="http://www.hsr.ch" target="_blank">HSR</a>.

"Well that is oddly specific." you might think. It is. In fact this data is attributed with the correct [schema.org/Person](http://schema.org/Person)
attributes. I'm hoping that Google eventually indexes me in it's knowledge graph ;-). So that you can type a query such as "What's the height of Theo Winter" and it
will answer correctly.
This page is my personal blog and place to show off some of my projects. :)
