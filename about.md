My name is [Theo Winter](http://theowinter.ch). I'm studying information science at [HSR](http://www.hsr.ch) in [Switzerland](http://www.admin.ch/). And this is my personal blog about all things that interest me.

Now you may be wondering why ghoul.io? It all came together pretty randomly, I've been on and off browsing for a cool new domain name for half a year. I wanted something short and easy to remember and if possible it should stand out from the crowd. Pretty standard if you think about it.. because who doesn't want a short and awesome domain name? So one day, when I was trying out various combinations on [shortdomainsearch.net](http://shortdomainsearch.net/), I saw ghoul.io. I thought that's actually a pretty cool domain and I could even use some random monster as mascot for the site. That'd be pretty unique. Being a fan of fantasy (books, films, games), I just had to buy the domain. And that's how ghoul.io was born.

## Planned content for ghoul.io:

* Commentary on tech news.
* Various tutorials and tricks about the unix shell, programming and maybe even art & game design.
* Cool programs and scripts that I've found in the depths of the net.
* Small "hacks" and how to protect yourself against them.
* Commentary on some of my personal projects.
* Reviews of hardware I'm using. I won't be going out of my way to buy hardware just to review it, but if there's a piece of hardware that I'm passionate about I may write a short review. (Or to warn people because something's incredibly crappy.)

## What software are you using?
I created this site with [Vim](http://vim.sexy), [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Also I'm using [MinimalMistake](http://mademistakes.com/articles/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/), a awesome & clean Jekyll theme made by Michael Rose.
