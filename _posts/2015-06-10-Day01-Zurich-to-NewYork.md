I'm flying from Zurich to New York with a short stop in Rejkiavic, Iceland. (I hope I got the spelling right.) As I'm writing this I'm in a Icelandair plane somewhere between Scottland and Iceland. Though I can only guess since there's a dense cloud cover below me. There's no inflight entertainment in this plane, but I was pleasantly surprised when they handed out iPads with some movies, music and games on them. I've just watched "A silver lining". It was pretty ok, though boring at times.

So far I'm quite happy with Iceland Air. The plane I'm on has three seats on each side of the hallway. And the seat next to me isn't taken which is essentially a free upgrade to economy premium. On the seat next to that there's a man travelling with his wife. I'm thinking he's an Icelander, since he didn't speak german nor a lot of english. But I can't be sure. Anyway I'm sharing the middle seat with him for our hand luggage.

I should arrive in Iceland at 17:45 (atm it's 17:15 swiss time). From there I'll then bord a plane to New York.

Alright I'm back in the air, this time bound for JFK New York. The transit in Iceland was kinda interesting, although it did work well enough. When I left my plane from Zürich I knew I had enough time. I arrived there at 15:50 (icelandic time) and the plane to JFK would leave at 17:00, with bording half an hour earlier. But oh boy the security. In order to get to the american departure terminal I first had to pass through one of six control booths where they check your passport, ticket and ask about why you're going to the US. Okay fine, that's not so bad, but there were a lot of people queueing and I was wondering why it went so slow. Turns out that right after the control booths all 6 lines of people merged into one that led yet to another security desk where they'd recheck the passport and ticket. But that desk was only manned by two woman. So yea..  of course the chain is only as fast as it's weakest link. As I was waiting there I saw them separate some people for special TSA controls.  

When I was finally through I was slightly worried that I'd have to hurry to catch my flight. But it ended up beeing half an hour late, so there weren't any problems and I ended up beeing one of the first to board. And of course, before boarding they checked everyone's passports and tickets a third time.

The plane I'm in now is somewhat bigger and it does have inflight entertainment. I was once more lucky enough to have the middle seat free for hand luggage. In the seat next to that is a nice american woman (in her fifties I'd say). She spent a week in Iceland and is now returing to the US. Back in the US she's visiting New York and then returning to San Francisco.
This encounter does confirm the idea that american people are, just as the myths say, more talkative/social then Europeans (of northern origin anyway). Of course this isn't entirely scientific with a sample size of one.

Anyway, I'm just rambling on because I'm bored. I saw a lot of ice stuff below me. I'll add a few pictures. Oh yea and before I forget some pictures of my inflight meal as well. Chicken salad.  It wasn't exactly bad, but the salad sauce had the consistency of mayonnaise.. but I'm not hungry now so there's that. 2h and 9minutes left.

Customs and border control when relatively well. I waited for like an hour and a half. But I guess it could have been a lot worse. After that I had to find my hotel. I decided to take the airtrain to Jamica station and the subway from there. I almost instantly regretted that decision when I saw the subway station beneath the airport. Homeless people everywhere and that smell and lots of trash. The subway ride itself worked fine though and the cart itself was moderately clean.
