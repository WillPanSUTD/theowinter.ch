title: City Break Budapest
description: "After the winter exams, it was time for another city break. I went to Budapest with my friends Nicola, Laura & Ryan, whom I had originally met on my USA trip last summer.
Budapest has the perfect mix of historic sites, nightlife and culture! Also food and drinks are quite affordable."
