title: A weekend in Berlin
description: "In order to make it to the end of the semester a quick city trip was necessary to satisfy my wanderlust. A reunion with some of my friends from the USA adventures was perfect for this. We rented an apartment close to the Alexanderplatz and had a lot of fun seeing all the attractions. Especially cool was a free walking tour about streetart and alternative culture in Berlin. The guide had also a lot of valuable tips for nightlife activities. So if you're in Berlin check out the 'alternative walking tour', they usually meet up at the tv tower and you don't need to book anything in advance."
