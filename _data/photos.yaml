      description: This "tree-house" was built by Osman Kalin during the separation of east and west Berlin for his family. Although the land it was built on belonged to east Berlin, it was physically located in the West German territory since the wall had not been curved to properly follow the border. A while after the wall fell the tree house was threatend to be demolished, so Osman Kalin concreted his furniture to the ground in order to make it harder to demolish. The local population also supported Osman and he was allowed to keep the property. When I was there in October 2015 Osman Kalin, now aged 90, was still living there.
